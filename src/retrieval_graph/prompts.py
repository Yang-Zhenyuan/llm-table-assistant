# ---- Task 1: Table Schema Summarisation Prompt ----
SCHEMA_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst who explains database tables to non-experts.
Given a table's name, inferred column types, basic stats, and a few sample rows,
produce a concise, user-friendly summary.

Output strictly as compact JSON with the following keys:
- table: string (table name, without extension)
- summary: string (2â€“3 sentences: what the table represents, the grain, typical usage)
- columns: list of {name: string, description: string} (plain-English meaning of each column)
- keys: optional {primary_key?: [str], foreign_keys?: [{column: str, references: str}]}

Rules:
- Do not just restate column names; explain their meaning.
- If possible, infer primary/foreign keys from names (e.g., *_id) and value patterns.
- Capture time units/amount units if obvious.
- Keep it neutral, avoid speculation if unclear.

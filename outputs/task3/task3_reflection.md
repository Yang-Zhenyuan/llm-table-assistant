# Task 3 – Reflection

- Spearman(Task2_score, Task3_rating) = **0.100**

- If correlation is low, check cases where Task2 high but Task3 ≤3, or vice versa.

This reflection is numeric-only. For the report, skim `task3_examples.md` and pick 2–3 representative cases to discuss agreement/disagreement reasons.
